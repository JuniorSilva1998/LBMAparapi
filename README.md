# LBMAparapi
Project for Lattice Boltzmann Method using Aparapi in a Java Program

The LBM program is a project I worked with as part of my university course.

It was written in Java and was developed using NetBeans IDE 8.2.

Aparapi may need to be initialized. In case of problems, follow these steps:
Go to "Aparapi" folder.
Copy the com folder to where the com folder is found in the system. This is found in "C:\Users\UserName\.m2\repository".

806612 is the project itself.
